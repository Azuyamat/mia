# Mia (Miu Remix)
> Ignore this project if you don't know what it is.
> 
> Moreover, use [Mia CLI](https://github.com/Azuyamat/mia_rust) instead.

## How to use

**Installation**
- [Download batch file](https://github.com/Azuyamat/mia/releases/download/1.1.0/mia.bat)
- Place it in a folder (not in your downloads)
- Run the batch file with administrator rights
- You can now delete the mia.bat if you'd like

**Tool usage**
- Shift + Right-Click any project folder and click on `Mia Zip` in the context menu
- Input a path (ex: `C:\code\foo.zip`) or specify a name (ex: `foo`) to create a zip with the name `foo` when prompted

### What did this do?

- Adds a registry value towards the `zip_proj.bat` file
- Creates the `zip_proj.bat` file which contains execution details for the `main.py` file
- Downloads the `main.py` file from this repository

## Where is the ZIP file?
The zip file should automatically pop up once it is created, if it doesn't it should be under the project directory.

## What does this look like?

> Note: Instead of `Zip Project` the name will appear as `Mia Zip`
